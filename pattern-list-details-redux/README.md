## List details pattern // City Viewer with Redux

A sample list details Enact application. This pattern focuses on layout for Enact apps.

This is a more scalable version of the City Viewer. It is hooked up with [Redux](http://redux.js.org/), using the presentational/container component pattern as laid out by Dan Abramov here: [Presentational and Container Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.sidi8whzp).

This layout is divided into Head and Body. Inside the Body component you can find the Sidebar and Content.

Run `npm install` then
`npm run serve` to have the app running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), where you can view it in your browser.

#### Enact Components used
- Divider
- IconButton
- Image
