# Enact Samples
Sample applications demonstrating the features and style of Enact

## Prerequisites

Before using the samples, the Enact command line tool must be installed globally. Use the following command to install it:

```sh
npm install -g @enact/cli
```

> Note: On Linux, it may be necessary to use `sudo` with the preceding command.

## Using the Samples

Each directory contains a sample Enact application demonstrating a particular concept or component. To run a sample, `cd` into the appropriate directory and then install the needed dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

To build the sample and start a local web server, use the `serve` command:

```sh
npm run serve
```

## The All Samples App

All samples may be accessed from a single app in the `enact-all-samples` directory. A list of samples is presented and individual samples may be run by clicking on a specific item. To return to the menu, hover the pointer near the upper right corner to reveal a hidden button.
