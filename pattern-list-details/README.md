## List details pattern // City Viewer

A sample list details Enact application. This pattern focuses on layout for Enact apps.

In this app, you can browse photos of different cities around the world.
This layout is divided into `Head` and `Body`. Inside the Body component you can find the `Sidebar` and `Content`.
`MainView` handles the state for picking a country and Body handles the state for picking the city to view.

Run `npm install` then
`npm run serve` to have the app running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), where you can view it in your browser.
