## Theming App

A sample Enact application that uses dynamic color change feature to style the components.

Run `npm install` then `npm run serve` to have the app running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), where you can view it in your browser.

This app will help you choose a preset or customize the Sandstone UI components for your application. On the left side of the app, you can see all the presets and/or customizable color fields, while on the right side is the `Live Preview` area. Any value changes you make inside the color fields will be reflected in `Live Preview`.

#### Customize Themes

The radio buttons on the first Panel allow you to choose a preset including Sandstone default skin.

On the second Panel you can interact with color fields by changing their value inside the input field, or by clicking the colored square which will open the basic color picker.

#### Reset Theme

The `Reset` button will revert all the changes to the active selected preset.
