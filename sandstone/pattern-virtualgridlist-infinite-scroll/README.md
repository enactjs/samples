## VirtualGridList With Infinite Scroll Pattern

A sample Enact application that shows off how to load items with infinite scroll in VirtualGridList.

Run `npm install` then `npm run serve` to have the app running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), where you can view it in your browser.

#### Enact Components Used
- `sandstone/ImageItem`
- `sandstone/Panels/Header`
- `sandstone/Panels/Panel`
- `sandstone/VirtualList/VirtualGridList`

In this app, load data when scrolling reaches the bottom of the virtualgridlist. Use your API server to data fetch to load the data.
Performance may decrease when using the onScroll handler, so use the onScrollStop handler like in the sample.
