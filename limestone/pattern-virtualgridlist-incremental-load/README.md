## Incremental Data Loading in VirtualGridList Pattern

A sample Enact application that demonstrates how to load items incrementally in a VirtualGridList.

Run `npm install` then `npm run serve` to have the app running on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080), where you can view it in your browser.

#### Enact Components Used
- `limestone/ImageItem`
- `limestone/Panels/Header`
- `limestone/Panels/Panel`
- `limestone/VirtualList/VirtualGridList`

In this app, data is loaded as you scroll to the bottom of the VirtualGridList. Use your API server to fetch data to load.
Performance may decrease when using the `onScroll` handler, so use the `onScrollStop` handler as shown in the sample.
